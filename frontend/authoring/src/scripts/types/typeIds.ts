/**
 * WARNING: Only export valid typeIds and their aliases. Exports from this file are considered the
 *          source of truth and the complete Set of valid typeIds.
 *
 * How to use this file:
 * import * as T from './typeIds'
 * You may now do `Asset<T.Survey>` as well as `const surv = { name: 'abc', typeId: T.Survey }`
 * Alternatively (assuming no other naming conflicts):
 * import { Survey } from './typeIds'
 * `Asset<Survey>` and `const surv = { name: 'abc', typeId: Survey }`
 *
 * Since every member of this module is overloaded with a const and type, the compiler chooses the
 * appropriate context from the module namespace. I have not been able to achieve this with
 *   object literals (b/c `Asset<typeof T.Survey>` is too verbose and creating a mapped type results
 *     in `Asset<T['Survey']>`, which is inarguably worse),
 *   enums (b/c same as object literals),
 *   interfaces (b/c they are not namespace for T.Survey access and creating a runtime map to gain
 *     this has the same drawbacks as an object literal),
 *   types (b/c same as interfaces)
 *
 * And thus we land on es6 modules for the namespacing and overloading for compile time and runtime
 * access. I have probably spent more time deciding this is the only path forward over the last few
 * months than all the time it will never save.
