    This method creates a reducer meant for a slice that is an id map

    For example, if we want to dispatch an action that
    only affects a single discussion post, we dispatch something like
        {
            type: 'Some discussion post action type',
            id: [the discussion post id],
            data: { ... }
        }
    the id denotes the targeted discussion post.

    This method provides a reusable wrapper for that behavior.
    @param singleReducer: Reducer
        This is the reducer for the single item. For the above example, this would be
        a reducer for a single discusison post that handles the action type as dispatched
    @param idProp: string
        the name of the field to use as an id. defaults to 'id'.
    @return Reducer
        a reducer that applies singleReducer to one entry in a map of id to object

    Utility to create a selector for selecting a single slice by a key from a list.
