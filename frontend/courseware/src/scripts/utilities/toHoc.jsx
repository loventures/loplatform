 * Converts a Render Prop to a function that returns an HoC
 * ex:
 * If you have a render prop `WithMouse`, that you use like:
 *
 *   <WithMouse every={500}>
 *     {mousePosition => (
 *       <div></div>
 *     )}
 *   </WithMouse>
 *
 * you can convert it to a HoC by calling:
 *
 *   const withMouse = toHoc(WithMouse)
 *
 * And then use that Hoc like:
 *
 *   withMouse({every: 500})(({mouse}) => (
 *     <div>Your mouse is at: {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}</div>
 *   ))
