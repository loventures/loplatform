/*
  At some point in history people decided to adopt a strange format
  for a list of things from an api call:
    an array with 3 custom fields on them,
    count, filterCount, totalCount
  This means that if we get results in a different format
  or if we want to operate on the results before we return it
  from the api services, we need to make sure the end result
  is still in that format.
*/

/*
  make the new results format:
    { total, partialResults: [...data] }
  look like the format we are used to.
*/
export const forPartialResults = ({ total, partialResults }) => {
  const results = partialResults.slice();
  results.count = partialResults.length;
  results.filterCount = total;
  results.totalCount = total;
  return results;
};

/*
  wrap operations over the list of results and keep all the counts
  e.g. instead of
    callAPI().then(results => map(results, someFn))
  do
    callAPI().then(withTransform(results => map(results, someFn)))
