/*
    IE and EDGE treat custom tags (including <math> which they do not support natively)
    very strictly and fails them for simple things like html lookup.
    i.e.
        $('math') //empty list
        var $math = $('.known-container-of-math').children();
        $math //list of 1
        $math.html() //undefined
        $math[0].innerHTML //undefined
    This issue causes MathJax to not be able to get the <math> content for
    inserted <math> dom elements.

    However, If we set it again as html text onto a ie/edge native element
    then MathJax can pick it up.

    So to make it work for ie/edge, we wrap math elements then resets the
    html into these containers before to typeset with MathJax
