/**
 * Annotation indicating that a component implementation method can accept app events
 * of a given type (the type of the first parameter). If the component is the recipient
 * of an app event of this type, then the annotated method will be invoked. The event
 * itself will be supplied as the first parameter. Other parameters will be injected
 * according to their {@link EventRel} and {@link EventSrc} annotations.
 *
 * A component will receive an app event of a given type if it is either the explicit
 * target of the event (e.g. a scheduled event), if it has explicitly registered in
 * the database to receive those events ({@link AppEventService#registerListener}), or
 * if it has registered as a global stateless recipient of the event type
 * ({@link OnEventBinding}).
