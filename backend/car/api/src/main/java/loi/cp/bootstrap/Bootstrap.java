/**
 * Declares a method as a domain bootstrap phase.
 *
 * The annotated method shall take either one parameter of
 * an object type that is deserializable by Jackson, or
 * two parameters:
 * - a {@code Long}, representing an item ID,
 *   or a facade/component backed by an item,
 * - an object type deserializable by Jackson.
 *
 * During bootstrapping of a domain, if the "bootstrap" object
 * contains a phase with the name specified in this annotation,
 * then this method will be invoked with the deserialized object(s)
 * in the phase's config:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     "bootstrap": [
 *          ...,
 *          {
 *              "phase": "{phase_name}",
 *              "config": { ... }
 *          }
 *      ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * If the phase is used in another phase's "setup" list, and the
 * annotated method takes two parameters, then the first argument
 * will be passed as the return value of the containing phase:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     "bootstrap": [
 *          ...,
 *          {
 *              "phase": "{outer_phase}",
 *              "config": { ... },
 *              "setup": [
 *                  {
 *                      "phase": "{inner_phase}",
 *                      ...
 *                  }
 *              ]
 *          }
 * </pre>
