/**
 * This is the default implementation of rights, and is the logic used in most cases.
 *
 * This queries for a SupportedRole matching 'role' within a context (i.e. domains/courses), grabs the rights assigned
 * to that role, and expands them using the Rights hierarchy.
 *
 *
 * i.e. Within a course, 'role' might bind to @role-trial-learner and have
 * [
 *  "loi.cp.course.right.LearnCourseRight",
 *  "-loi.cp.course.right.FullContentRight"
 * ]
 * This code will expand LearnCourseRight but restrict FullContentRight, giving
 * [
 *  "loi.cp.course.right.TrialContentRight"
 *  "loi.cp.course.right.ReadCourseRight"
 *  "loi.cp.course.right.CourseParticipationRight"
 *  "loi.cp.course.right.InteractCourseRight"
 *  "loi.cp.course.right.LearnCourseRight"
 * ]
 * as the final set of rights provided for the user.
