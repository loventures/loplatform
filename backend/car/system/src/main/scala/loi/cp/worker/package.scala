/** The root package of the DE worker machinery.
  *
  * We have a recurring need to do things in the background, not attached to any Tomcat request handler thread. We also
  * need once-and-only-once semantics, or at least as close to them as we can practically get, so the `Executor` queue
  * is not a good fit. These requirements come up in relation to many and varied product features, such as course
  * provisioning, notifications, and email. The worker machinery is an attempt to bring a small amount of code reuse to
  * bear on this problem.
  *
  * Each worker consists of a pair of threads: a `Poll` thread that periodically polls the database to acquire and
  * enqueue new work and a `Queue` thread that pops work items from the shared queue and executes them. The `Poll`er
  * should atomically update the work items to mark them as "enqueued", and should also periodically resurrect abandoned
  * work. The `Queue` thread periodically marks the work items as still enqueued, to prevent their work from being
  * stolen by another appserver.
  *
  * See the documentation on the abstract methods in `AbstractWorker` for detail on the implementation requirements.
