  /** Similar to the above, this is specifically for custom shared data types specified via 'adlcp:data > adlcp:map'
    * fields. This is not well documented on the SCORM website, but it was evident from many of the demo SCORM files as
    * well as support from scorm.com.
    *
    * Unlike the above, this is shared/universal to the course. Example files demonstrated this as a continual storage
    * for student notes, though one could imagine other uses. Because of the prevalence in the SCORM examples, I decided
    * to include it, although it is a significant additional complexity. Also because of its weirdness, it is hard to
    * "fake" include, since data is written using "adl.data.n.store" instead of just "cmi.the.data".
    *
    * That said, while <adlcp:map targetID="com.scorm.example.notes" readSharedData="true" writeSharedData="true"/> is
    * supposed to produce something like { "adl.data.0.id": "com.scorm.example.notes", "adl.data.0.store": "most useful
    * notes" } for the frontend, on the backend we will just store { "com.scorm.example.notes": "most useful notes" }
    * because it is much easier to process, in particular the part where we constrain this shared storage to only the
    * types used by this SCORM asset. That means that "com.scorm.example.notes" and "com.scorm.example.analytics" could
    * both be stored in this object, but this SCORM asset will only served "com.scorm.example.notes" if that is the only
    * one described in its imsmanifest.xml file
