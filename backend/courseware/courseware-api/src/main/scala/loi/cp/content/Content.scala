/** A usage of an asset with customisation. "Usage" means that reused assets have one "content" per usage. To
  * distinguish two content instances for the same asset, use `edgePath`. The asset for this content is actually
  * represented by the edge that arrives at the asset (targets the asset).
  *
  * This is a fatter version of `CourseContent` because it contains the entire edge to the asset instead of just the
  * edge's name, target, and data. The only reason this does not replace `CourseContent` is because 1) `CourseContent`
  * is thin enough to go in the CourseContents cache. We tried putting this one in it and performance was noticeably
  * worse and 2) `CourseContent` can hold the root course asset but `Content` cannot, because there is no edge to the
  * root course asset (Kangland doesn't recognize the program-course edge).
  *
  * @param ancestorEdgeNames
  *   the names of edges from the root to this content, but excluding `edge.name`.
  * @param edge
  *   the asset used for this content, represented by the edge that arrives at the asset usage.
  * @param overlay
  *   customisation of this asset usage
  * @param category
  *   gradebook category
  * @param survey
  *   associated survey edge and asset name
