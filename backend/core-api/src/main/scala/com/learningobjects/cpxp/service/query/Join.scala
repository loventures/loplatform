/** A join to a `QueryBuilder`.
  *
  * Applying a `Join` to a base `QueryBuilder` has the effect of causing the entity queried by `query` to be joined to
  * the base query being built, joining `query`'s `rightDataType` against the datum specified by `leftDataType` on the
  * base query.
  *
  * Left and right outer joins can contain additional conditions to be applied in the join's `ON` clause rather than in
  * the outermost `WHERE` clause. This is necessary where you want the joined rows to be filtered *before* the join is
  * calculated, so filtered rows on one side do not filter their joined rows.
