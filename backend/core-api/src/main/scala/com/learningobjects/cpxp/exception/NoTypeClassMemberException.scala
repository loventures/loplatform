/** There are some type classes being used for behavior that used to use subtype polymorphism. Therefore, to accommodate
  * the clients that were using dynamic dispatch, the type class has to have a member for a broad type (such as Asset or
  * even Any) and that member has to pattern match on all the "subtypes". This exception is for those type class members
  * to use for their default case. The transition from subtype polymorphism to type classes closes the system for
  * extension, so it might not be a good idea at all. But what is also a bad idea is forcing irrelevant traits into the
  * type hierarchy. For example, Asset is in authoringApi and it can't have supertraits from downstream verticals. Thus
  * those other verticals are forced to use something like type classes. And thus they loose their dynamic dispatch.
