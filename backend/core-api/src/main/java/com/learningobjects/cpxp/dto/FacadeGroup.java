/**
 * Annotates method on facade to identify its grouping with other methods.
 *
 * E.g., getProperty, getProperty, getProperties are all part of the same group, "Properties". In general, this is inferred by the name and return type cardinality (object vs collection). If getProperties were called something non-standard, or if the framework had difficulty inferring the group name (e.g., it can't tell if properties needs to be pluralized), this annotation can be used to specifically associate this accessor with the "Properties" group.
