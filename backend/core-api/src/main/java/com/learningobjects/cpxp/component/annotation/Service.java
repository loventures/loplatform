 *
 * If used to annotate a class, it indicates that that class is a stateless service that needs to be
 * injected into other classes, and the annotation's attributes define behaviors of the DI.  The @Service annotated
 * class will have its own members injected into it on creation.
 *
 * If used on an interface, it indicates that its implementation will be an @Service-annotated class.  Attributes are
 * not used in this case.
 *
 * If used to annotate a member, it indicates that this member needs to be created through dependency injection and
 * will search for a class annotated with @Service of the desired type.  Attributes are not used in this case.
