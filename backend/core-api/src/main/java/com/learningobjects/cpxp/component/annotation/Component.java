 * 2. Used on managed components that can be turned on or off through "Managed Components" in the admin portal.
 * Fundamentally, @Component will put an entry in a component registry (which is used by such things as the managed
 * components admin portal and the item type mapping).
 *
 * Although things annotated with @Component will have members dependency injected into them, this annotation
 * should not be used solely to get dependency injection.
