/**
 * Exposes a function to be accessible via an RPC call as a GET request
 * (NOTE: This is part of an old paradigm and not encouraged for use in new code)
 *
 * This can be accessed by using the $$rpc function and passing in the name, for example:
 *     "$$rpc('appevents')"
 * Alternatively, and more commonly, this can be accessed by getting the base RPC object (from $$rpc('')) and adding on the method name
 * For example, to invoke 'appevents' on AppEventView.java:
 *     _rpcBase = "$$rpc('')"
 *     ...
 *     "sAjaxSource": _rpcBase + 'appevents',
 * Note that the $$rpc(...) class is implied by context, because appEventView.html was invoked from the 'render' call in AppEventView.java
