/**
 * Binds a Java method to an HTTP method and path.
 *
 * Methods that host {@link RequestMapping} can have very flexible signatures. In any
 * order, the signature can declare the following parameter types:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link HttpServletRequest}/{@link HttpServletResponse} objects. Use as a
 *     Feature of Last Resort. Neither of these objects
 *     will be wrapped in any protective wrappers. A component author can commit the
 *     response. That will probably break something. If you are using these, let me
 *     know. What you are doing should probably be integrated into the framework
 *     somehow.</li>
 *     <li>{@link WebRequest} A richer {@code HttpServletRequest}</li>
 *     <li>{@link PathVariable} annotated parameter types. These provide access to URI
 *     template variables defined in {@link #path()}. {@code PathVariable} parameter
 *     types can be any type that has a {@link StringConverterComponent} enabled in the
 *     domain. String and Long do.</li>
 *     <li>{@link HttpSession} The container-provided session object</li>
 *     <li>{@link HttpContext} An object wrapping request, response, and session
 *     objects, for convenience.</li>
 *     <li>{@link ServiceMeta} The current {@link ServiceMeta} object providing
 *     information about the node and cluster that the request is being processed by.</li>
 *     <li>{@link DomainDTO} The current domain.</li>
 *     <li>{@link RequestBody} annotated parameter type. This provides access to the
 *     HTTP message body. The message body is converted to the parameter type using
 *     {@link HttpMessageConverter}s.</li>
 *     <li>{@link QueryParam} annotated parameter types. These provide access to query
 *     string variables in the HTTP message. {@code QueryParam} parameter types can be
 *     any type that has a {@link StringConverterComponent} enabled in the domain.
 *     String and Long do.</li>
 *     <li>{@link ApiQuery} This object will hold the values of pagination, filtering,
 *     and sorting matrix parameters.</li>
 *     <li>{@link ApiPage} This object will hold the values of pagination matrix
 *     parameters. This will be deprecated soon. Use {@code ApiQuery}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When used to annotated a type, {@link #path()} is the only legal element. A runtime
 * exception will occur when the domain is loaded if any other element is specified.</p>
 *
 * <p>When used on a method, at least one of {@link #path()} or {@link #method()} must
 * be provided. A runtime exception will occur when the domain is loaded if neither
 * element is specified. When {@link #path()} is empty, the declaring class of the method
 * must have a {@code RequestMapping}.</p>
