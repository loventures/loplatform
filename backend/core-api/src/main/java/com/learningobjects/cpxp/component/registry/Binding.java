/**
 * Declares an annotation as a binding annotation.
 *
 * <p>A binding annotation is an annotation whose declaration on a subtype of a {@link
 * Bound} type will cause that subtype to be registered in the {@link Bound}'s registry.
 * The details of how the subtype is bound and, subsequently, how it can be retrieved, is
 * left to the registry type. A common scenario is for elements on the binding annotation
 * to be used to build a key for the subtype, and the registry instance is like a map.
 *
 * <p>Note that the subtype's {@link DelegateDescriptor} is what is actually bound in the
 * registry, not the subtype's {@link Class}.</p>
