/**
 * Annotation describing how a primary component interface (category) is
 * mapped to an item type, and optionally how implementations are mapped
 * to data types.
 *
 * Use this, for example, to specify that gradebook implementations should
 * be mapped to items of type "Gradebook", or that group implementations
 * should be selected based on the "type" data field of the "Group" item.
 *
 * If no item mapping is specified, components are stored as item type
 * "Component". If no data mapping is specified, the "componentId" field
 * identifies the implementation.
