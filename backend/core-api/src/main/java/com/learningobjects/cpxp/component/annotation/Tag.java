/**
 * Indicates that the annotated method defines a LOHTML tag.
 *
 * When a component class is added as a namespace in a LOHTML
 * document using {@code xmlns:foo="loi.cp..."}, then usages
 * of the tag {@code <foo:method ...>} will be rendered by
 * invoking the annotated method on the component associated
 * with the {@code foo} namespace.
 *
 * Attributes of the tag are passed as {@link Parameter}s of
 * the method. If more attributes than expected are passed to
 * the tag, they are accessible by declaring a parameter
 * {@code @Parameters Map<String, Object> parameters}, which
 * will be populated with the unrecognized parameter values.
 *
 * Parameters may be marked as {@link Required} to throw an
 * exception during rendering if not included.
 *
 * If the tag has a body, it can be accessed by taking a parameter
 * named {@code body} of type {@link Callable}, which can be called
 * any number of times to render the contents of the tag as LOHTML.
 *
 * The method may also accept any parameters evaluable
 * by a known {@link Evaluator}, such as the request object.
 *
 * This annotation is mainly used in legacy LOHTML code and should
 * generally not be used in new development.
