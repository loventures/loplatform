/**
 * Marks a method to be called after an instance of a component is created and persisted to the database. Should be
 * used to initialize the database state of a newly created component instance. This is the closest approximation
 * we have to a proper constructor that is aware of the Component Environment.
 * <br>
 * Contrast with {@link javax.annotation.PostConstruct} which is invoked after a JVM instance is loaded into memory
 * and DI has occurred.
 * <br>
 * Parameters on a PostCreate method are inferred using the {@link com.learningobjects.cpxp.component.eval.InferEvaluator}
 * which looks in {@link com.learningobjects.cpxp.service.Current} for any objects with types matching the parameters.
 * There are a few ways to inject the params into a PostCreate method.
 * <br>
 * First, regular DI types such as services can be used as expected. In some cases, such as group creation
 * (see ManageGroup#submitGroup) we add to Current manually. Finally, if a Facade ADD method has parameters,
 * these parameters will be added to Current by {@link com.learningobjects.cpxp.service.facade.FacadeComponentHandler}
 * before triggering the PostCreate Lifecycle (see TaxonomyParentFacade#addTaxonomy). After the add, they are removed.
