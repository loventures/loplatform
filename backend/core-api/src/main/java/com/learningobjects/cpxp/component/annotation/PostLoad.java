/**
 * A post-load lifecycle method is run once per appserver per component. It is run the first time a particular
 * component type is loaded into a component environment on the appserver after tomcat startup or after forced
 * component environment reload. Reconfiguring a domain will not trigger a post-load rerun.
 *
 * These are intended for JVM-wide resource pre-allocation.
