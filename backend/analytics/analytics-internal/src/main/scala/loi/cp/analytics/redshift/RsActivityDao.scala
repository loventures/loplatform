/** Each row of the activity table is one change to a grade, attempt, or progress for a section-user-edgepath. It is
  * actually quite scant on facts. I can think of dozens of more columns to put on it. But right now its sole purpose is
  * to enable a subscription to said changes. The subscriber is left to discover what the specific activity was once
  * they are told something happened.
  *
  * The `id` and `etlTime` columns are to assist the subscription implementation. They are not facts about the activity.
  * For example, `etlTime` is the start time of the ETL execution that inserted the activity row and thousands of other
  * rows will have the same value. It is not the time of the activity. The `id` is not the analyticeventfinder id. Many
  * analyticeventfinders may be present in one ETL execution for the same section-user-edgepath and only one activity
  * row is written.
