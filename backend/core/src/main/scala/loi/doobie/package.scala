    // Notes for future me in case:
    //
    // If everyone was in UTC, or if the Redshift driver supported java.time.*, or if the
    // Redshift driver had a config option to override the client time zone to UTC, then
    // we could avoid this. java.sql.Timestamp is what we are stuck with and it is just a
    // wrapper around epoch seconds (always in UTC). The problem is the driver's parsing
    // to Timestamp grabs a local calendar, which causes the driver to assume that any
    // timestamp value from the db is in the client timezone. Note, we are not using
    // timestampz values because that is for if we wanted to store times in multiple
    // time zones, and we do not. The timestamp datatype retains no timezone, it is just
    // a naked, unitless, zoneless, datetime. So if we store 10:43 in a timestamp column
    // the driver reads 10:43 EST if the driver is in Washington, DC in February. Since
    // Timestamp's heart is epoch seconds in UTC the driver accordingly adds 5 hours
    // of seconds to 10:43 EST. So 10:43 (naked) became 15:43 UTC. The solution in our
    // specific case, is to _not_ store the times in UTC. Store them in the client time.
    // For jenkins and the prod app servers this is UTC, so we are fine. For local devs
    // this is fine because the local devs are just running tests that drop/add the
    // schema every x minutes. This way, 10:43 is meant to be EST not UTC, so it is fine
    // that the driver interprets it as 15:43 UTC.
    //
    // Only one problem remains, which this function works around. The Redshift functions
    // getdate() and current_date are critical to several views. They use the session
    // time zone (the connection time zone) and that defaults to UTC. Since we are storing
    // dates in client times, then these functions need to use client time. Thus, we set
    // the time zone with this.
    // https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_timezone_config.html
    // hoepfully all the ZoneIds ppl actually use match the pg ones in that documentation
