/** JPA support for TSVertor entity values.
  *
  * Formerly we decoded TSVector types inside the entity classes; for example, public void setFullName(String fullName)
  * { this.fullName = TSVector.fromTsVector(fullName); } however this led to Hibernate occasionally thinking the user *
  * dirty, because the original property value from the database did not match the property in the entity. This user
  * type pushes that decoding down beneath Hibernate so that the entities no longer seem as dirty to Hibernate.
  *
  * The hypersistence has a tsvector type but I don't understand it and it offers no control over the vector language.
