/* This is something of a crap class loader. It loads classes from the component
 * environment by scanning the archive class loaders, but they have no linkage
 * with this class loader, they simply defer to the thread-local ComponentRing
 * to see where to load classes they need. Really, all the archive class loaders
 * should be children of this and then the standard parent delegation might, in
 * some way, work. With such a configuration, when you asked an archive class
 * loader for a class, it would call the environment class loader which would
 * in turn ask all the archive class loaders (including you). If we really
 * cared, the environment class loader would in fact be a ring class loader. */
