/**
 * Used to specify a validator for a specific component. E.g., UserComponent is validated by UserComponentValidator.
 *
 * As opposed to validators that operate on single properties, ComponentValidator allow use to define (potentially complex) business logic-based validation on the entire component.
 *
 * Note that component validators are themselves components, so multiple implementations can be defined and disabled/enabled or configured. If an implementation is not defined for a validator, then no validation is performed.
 *
 * E.g., one implementation of UserComponentValidator is CarnegieUserComponentValidator, which handles Carnegie-specific constraints (e.g., a teacher ID must be unique within the district). Unless this is enabled in component configuration for a domain, it will not be used to validate a user.
 *
 * Validation occurs after an SRS PATCH request, and can be manually performed by {@code com.learningobjects.component.validator.ComponentValidatorService#validate}.
