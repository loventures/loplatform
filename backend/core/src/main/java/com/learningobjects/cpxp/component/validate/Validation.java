/**
 * Marks an annotation as an RPC validation annotation.
 *
 * RPC parameters annotated with the target annotation will be
 * validated using the {@link Validator} specified by {@link #value}.
 *
 * Before the RPC method is invoked, the validator's {@link Validator#validate}
 * method will be called with the RPC target's instance, context, and the
 * supplied value for the annotated parameter. If it returns {@code null},
 * then the RPC proceeds as usual. If it returns a non-null {@code String},
 * then an error is returned to the client with the return value as the
 * error message.
 *
 * This is an RPC framework annotation and should not be used in new code.
