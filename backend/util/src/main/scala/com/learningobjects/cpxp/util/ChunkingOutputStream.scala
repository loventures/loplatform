/** An `OutputStream` that progressively fills up `File`s of a given size with the data passed to it, and returns those
  * files via a callback.
  * @param sz
  *   The size of all chunked `File`s, in bytes, except possibly the last one, which will be no bigger than this size.
  * @param seed
  *   An initial value for the accumulator parameter to `handler`
  * @param handler
  *   A callback which will be passed every `File` as it is produced. A parameter of type `R` is threaded through
  *   multiple invocations of this function.
