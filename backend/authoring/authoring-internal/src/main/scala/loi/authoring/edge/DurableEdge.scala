// existence of this service object is barely justified because the entity type is nearly identical, but this gives us
//   1. the copy function that all case classes have, which the tests use to swap the branch
//   2. a detached object, which the entity is not. With this service object, service callers don't have the opportunity
//      to forget to Session.evict before mutating the entity.
//   3. not being a sore thumb amongst the rest of the authoring entities, none of which intend the session-attachable
//      entity types for general use.
