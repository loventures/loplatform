// That `project` is present on durable edge is a great shame.
// Shallow-project-copy creates a new project whose head commit is the head of the origin project.
// It produces two diverge-able projects with the same node and edge names.
// For many years we did not track durable edge, so a drop-add in the origin project and/or a drop-add in the
// copy would produce two new edge names between the same two source and target names.
// Thus the project_id has to be present, forever, on the durable edge entity.
