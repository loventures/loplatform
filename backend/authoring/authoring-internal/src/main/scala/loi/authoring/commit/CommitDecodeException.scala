// thrown by methods on Hibernate Proxies, amongst other places.
// When thrown by a Hibernate proxy, the exception is nested as the `target` of a wrapping `InvocationTargetException`
// When logging these InvocationTargetExceptions, the `target`'s message is elided ?why?
// Our `target`'s message is the most important part, carrying the id of the corrupted authoringcommitdoc.
// Through trial and error, NOT placing a cause on this exception resulted in no elision
// DbTests can't cover this as the exceptions don't show up as an `InvocationTargetException` there /shrug
