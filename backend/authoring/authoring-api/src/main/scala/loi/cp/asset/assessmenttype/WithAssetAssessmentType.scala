    * polymorphism. This closes the system for extension which is unfortunate, but 1) it is better than putting
    * non-authoring traits in the type hierarchy of asset types and 2) the system wasn't open anyway (front-end apps and
    * provisioning can't be), so having islands of open extensibility is pointless. This means that this class must have
    * a compile-time dependency on all asset types that are WithAssetAssessmentType.
