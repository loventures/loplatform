  * @param edgeId
  *   unique value amongst all out-edges of a node. When a node is duplicated, the edgeId is cloned. Whereas `name` is
  *   generated anew. This mechanism allows source nodes to use edgeIds to refer to edges such that a duplication allows
  *   us to copy the source data verbatim.
