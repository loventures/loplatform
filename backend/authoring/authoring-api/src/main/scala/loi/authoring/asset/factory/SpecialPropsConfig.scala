/** Indicates the special asset properties that a asset data class has. A data class can pick and choose which of these
  * properties it defines. Special properties have special behavior in various areas of the asset framework. For
  * example, asset search only searches `title`, `subtitle`, and `keywords`, so there is value in an asset's data class
  * defining those properties. Also, all special properties are stored specially, in their own column.
  *
  * @param title
  *   true if the data type has a `title` property.
  * @param subtitle
  *   true if the data type has a `subtitle` property.
  * @param desc
  *   true if the data type has a `description` property
  * @param keywords
  *   true if the data type has a `keywords` property
  * @param archived
  *   true if the data type has an 'archived' property
  * @param attachmentId
  *   true if the data type has an 'attachmentId' property
