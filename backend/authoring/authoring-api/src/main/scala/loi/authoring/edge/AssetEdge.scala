/** An edge between two asset nodes
  *
  * @param id
  *   the id
  * @param name
  *   the edge name is the same value for all versions of the edge, like a filename in git. The edge name is unique in a
  *   workspace.
  * @param edgeId
  *   the edge id is used by the source node of the edge to refer to the edge in a data value. The edge id is the same
  *   value for all versions of the edge. The edge id is unique amongst the edges of the source.
  * @param source
  *   the source node of this edge
  * @param target
  *   the target node of this edge
  * @param group
  *   the group of this edge. This value can be used to give meaning to a set of targets. The same target can appear in
  *   more than one group, but not more than once in the same group.
  * @param position
  *   a 0-indexed value that orders the edges. Amongst a `group` of edges, the position must be unique and gap-less and
  *   the range must start at 0.
  * @param traverse
  *   whether or not the edge is traversed in clone or import. This value has special and slightly different meaning to
  *   clone and import.
  * @param data
  *   data about this edge
